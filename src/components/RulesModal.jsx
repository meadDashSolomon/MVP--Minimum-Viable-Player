      HOW TO PLAY IMMACULATE GRID BASEBALL
      Select a player for each cell that matches the criteria for that cell's row and column.
      You have nine guesses to fill out the grid.
      Each guess, whether correct or incorrect, counts as a guess.
      There is a new grid every day at midnight ET.
      A player cannot be used twice.
      Players may be active or inactive.
      Previous names of franchises will qualify. For example, Expos players will match for the Nationals and Browns players will match for the Orioles.
      For player and team cell: player must have played at least one major league game (in the regular season or playoffs) for that team.
      For team and award cell: The player must have won the award in a season he appeared for that team. The exception is All - Star selections, which are only associated with a single team. For example, Joey Gallo was an All - Star in 2021 and split the season between Texas and New York. He represented the Rangers in the All - Star game, so he would match for Rangers All - Stars but not Yankees All - Stars. However, other award winners that played for multiple teams can match any team they played for. In 2019, Zack Greinke won the Gold Glove and Silver Slugger while playing for both Houston and Arizona. He would qualify for those awards for either team.
      Hall of Famers can be inducted from any category (player, team, umpire, executive/pioneer) but must have played a major league game for the team in question.
      World Series winners must have appeared in a postseason game (or be on the postseason roster) for the team during the World Series-winning season to qualify.
      For team and season stat: The player must have recorded the stat while on that team. For players who played on multiple teams in a season, the stat must have been recorded with that team. For example, in 2017 J.D.Martinez hit 45 home runs in a season split between Detroit and Arizona. He would not match for 40 HR for either team because he hit 16 with Detroit and 29 for Arizona.
      For team and career stat: The player who reached the career stat simply had to play for the team at any point. For example, Randy Johnson would match for 3,000 strikeouts even though he had 2,162 for Seattle and 2,077 for Arizona. Career rate stats have minimums of 3,000 plate appearances and 1,000 innings.
      New 7/11/2023: If one of the stats is a rate stat (BA, ERA, etc.), the player must have qualified for the seasonâ€™s rate stat leaderboards.
      For two stat/awards cells: The player did not necessarily need to accomplish the stats/awards in the same season. For example, Willie McCovey would qualify for 40 + HR and Rookie of the Year.
